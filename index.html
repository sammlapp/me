    <b>About: </b>
    <br><br>
        Sam Lapp is a first-year masters student in the M.S. Engineering Design program. He is interested in Design Thinking and using design skills to address problems in the developing world. Currently, Sam is involved in several engineering projects. In the Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) program, he is working on a project aimed at reducing post-harvest losses for rural farmers in Kenya. In the Global Engineering Teams (GET) program, he is working with students in South Africa and a sponsor in Germany to develop an alignment device to quantify and simplify the dynamic alignment process for lower-limb prosthetics. At the Penn State Center of Health Organization Transformation (CHOT), Sam develops and tests Machine Learning algorithms for classifying patints using population health data from electronic medical records.
        <br> <br>
        Outside of Engineering, Sam is a musician, runner, and community organizer. He lives at The Co.Space, a coliving space for young people interested in creating change in their community. His passion project called <a class="myLink" href="http://grooveroom.weebly.com">The Groove Room </a> creates opportunities for local musicians to come together for one-day music writing and recording blitzes. He studies classical and jazz piano at Penn State, and plays local gigs with the band <a class="myLink" href="http://dopplerpoppins.com"> Doppler Poppins</a>. Sam also runs with Penn State Club Cross Country, and is usually training for one marathon or another.
